### Semi-automatic event planner

The goal of the project is to make an automatic system analyze user's agenda and agendas of all participants of user's event to make predictions 
where and when the event can happen.

Currently automatic time and venue prediction functionality is in the development. But users already can plan their events manually and invite particicpants.
